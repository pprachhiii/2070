## **Project Idea**

A **web-based platform** enabling users to:

- Explore predicted wildlife distribution in India by 2070
- Simulate environmental and conservation scenarios
- Understand the effects of human activity on wildlife
- Engage with interactive maps, charts, and species profiles

---

## **Target Users**

- Students and educators (biology, environmental science)
- Wildlife enthusiasts and researchers
- General users interested in conservation, climate change, and Indian wildlife

---

## **Core Goals**

1. Show predicted wildlife distribution and populations in India in 2070
2. Educate users on the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems
3. Enable interactive “what-if” simulations
4. Promote awareness of conservation actions

---

## **Features & Functionality**

### **1. Interactive Wildlife Map**

- Full India map showing predicted species habitats
- Hover: Quick tooltips with species counts
- Click: Detailed state-level charts, species lists, and images
- Optional zoom for district-level data
- Data from static JSON files, color-coded heatmaps

### **2. Population Simulation Sliders**

- Simulate effects of:

  1. Urbanization
  2. Deforestation
  3. Climate change
  4. Conservation efforts

- Real-time updates on population numbers, charts, and Eco-Scores

### **3. Species Profiles**

- Detailed pages for each species with:

  - Current and predicted 2070 populations
  - Threats and conservation status
  - Images, videos, and fun facts

- Navigation via map clicks or dropdown

### **4. Environmental Health Score (Eco-Score)**

- Quantifies overall environmental health per state
- Factors: Forest cover, wildlife health, water availability, air quality
- Visualizations: Progress bars, radar charts, color-coded maps
- Dynamic updates based on simulation sliders or actions

### **5. Conservation Action Simulator**

- Users apply interventions to improve environmental and wildlife health:

  - Plant trees
  - Create wildlife corridors
  - Anti-poaching measures

- Immediate visual feedback on populations and Eco-Scores

### **6. Comparative Analytics**

- Side-by-side comparison of multiple states or species under the same environmental scenario
- Interactive charts: Overlay two species populations for intuitive comparison
- Statistical indicators such as percentage growth, variance, or confidence intervals

### **7. Interactive Alerts and Events**

- Highlight critical species at risk or endangered hotspots with attention-grabbing markers
- Trigger real-time alerts when an Eco-Score drops below a defined threshold for a state
- Filter alerts by severity or species group (mammals, birds, reptiles)

### **8. Advanced Simulation Options**

- Integrate additional environmental factors:

  - Pollution levels (air, water, soil)
  - Invasive species impact
  - Water scarcity events and drought conditions
  - Forest fragmentation or urban expansion

- Enable multi-factor scenarios to see combined effects

### **9. Advanced Visualizations**

- Heatmaps with multiple intensity and gradient layers for species density, threat levels, or habitat quality
- Chord diagrams to illustrate species interdependence or predator-prey relationships
- Animate migrations and movements of species over time using dynamic map overlays
- Layered map filters to toggle between species, threats, or ecosystem services

---

## **Future Scope**

### **1. Temporal Analysis**

- Introduce a dynamic timeline slider to explore wildlife populations over multiple years (2020 to 2070)
- Display species-specific population trends with line graphs and rate-of-change indicators
- Include forecasting projections using historical data and predictive models, showing optimistic and pessimistic scenarios

### **2. Data-Driven Insights and Recommendations**

- Incorporate simple AI and ML predictive models to forecast outcomes based on interventions
- Generate automatic, actionable recommendations, e.g., planting trees to increase tiger population
- Provide contextual explanations for predictions

### **3. Environmental Policies and Historical Context**

- Simulate policy impacts, e.g., if a state bans deforestation, show projected species population recovery
- Include historical population trends for comparison
- Visualize policy effectiveness through interactive dashboards
